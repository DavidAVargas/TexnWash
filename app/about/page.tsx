            <p>
              Hey y‚Äôall ‚Äî I‚Äôm a proud Fort Worth local who started Tex N Wash with one mission: to bring professional, reliable, and convenient pressure washing services to the community I love.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#4E3629]">The Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
              I started this company after needing some home services myself and realizing there were very few companies that had a great website, solid communication, or even showed up on time. That‚Äôs where Tex N Wash comes in ‚Äî we‚Äôre setting a new standard in Fort Worth for what it means to be professional, easy to work with, and proud of our work.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-[#4E3629] uppercase tracking-wide">Our Cleaning Methods</h3>
            <p>
              We specialize in soft washing ‚Äî a powerful but safe cleaning method that uses eco-friendly bleach solutions combined with a surfactant (a soap) to break down dirt, algae, and grime. The soap not only enhances cleaning but also masks any bleach odor, so you get a fresh, clean result without the harsh smell.
            </p>
            <p>
              We take extra care by watering all nearby plants and grass before, during, and after cleaning to ensure no harm is done to your landscape. Unlike others, we strictly follow Texas environmental regulations by managing wastewater runoff properly. Instead of letting dirty water flow into the street or sewage system, we use a pump to redirect it to safe areas of your lawn or a designated spot approved by you.
            </p>
            <p className="bg-[#fff3e0] border-l-8 border-[#BD5700] p-6 rounded shadow-md font-medium text-[#4E3629]">
              ‚ö†Ô∏è Many companies skip proper containment ‚Äî but unmanaged chemical runoff can lead to hefty fines (up to $25,000 per day) for both the business and homeowner. At <span className="font-bold">Tex‚ÄØN‚ÄØWash</span>, we go the extra mile to protect your property, the environment, and your peace of mind.
